# JIRA Service Desk Share With Customer Customization

Ok, so that JIRA Service Desk "Share with Customer" button is really in the way, sometimes you don't want it, sometimes you click it by accident... With this extension, no more :)

## FAQ

### How can I hide the "Share with Customer" button

The extension has a internal settings page for you to customize it's behavior. Click the icon on your Chrome toolbar or go to Settings -> More tools -> Extensions -> JIRA Service Desk Comment Button Switcher -> Details -> Extension Options to access the settings.

Check 'Disable "Share With Customer"' checkbox to hide the "Share with Customer" button.

### I would like to report a problem

Feel free to use the Issues page to post any problems, questions or discussions.

### Does it change any JIRA settings?

Nope, the extension is installed on your browser and it changes the layout when you visit a JIRA page. It does not access your organization's JIRA settings.

### Does the keyboard shortcut still work?

Yes, the keyboard shortcuts on the comment section should still work as usual (default: alt + s = Comment Internally)
